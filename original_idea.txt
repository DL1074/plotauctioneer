how hard would it be to build a plugin

that utilizes worldedit

for when somebody builds a certain structure, uses "worldedit" and cuts (copy paste cut) the structure and saves it as a schematic in a nearby folder and gives him a item, maybe custom texture. 
the world edit will base its pasting at the center of said plot of land

the custom item is then placed on the ground by another player
this item will disappear from their inventory
the worledit will paste this item onto the land, the schematic will be deleted and disappear from the stored folder.

so the idea is 
custom command -> gives you the wooden axe -> select two points like world edit -> say confirm -> said plot is copied from world -> determines middle point of the plot -> saves plot as schematic -> sets the original plot to air effectively deleting it -> gives player custom data item block that represents said schematic


the item can be sold, auctioned, etc.

when the player who now wants to put it down

his placement location will be the midpoint of the schematic and will be pasted in which
places block -> finds schematic -> loads schematic -> pastes schematic -> deleletes schematic from save folder
